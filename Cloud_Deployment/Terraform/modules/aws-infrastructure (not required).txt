Not required because if you want to create your own s3 bucket, you need to provide your access key and secret key in my S3Uploader flask app
and recreate the docker file for the flask app and push to vikrammvk/uploads3:latest

# S3 bucket for saving twitter images
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "twitter_image_bucket" {
  bucket = var.bucket_name
  

  tags = {
    Name        = "twitter_clone_final_prj"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "twitter_image_bucket" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.twitter_image_bucket.id
